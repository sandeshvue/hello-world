5.coversion of datatypes: a} implicit conversion-- done by the compiler when there is no loss of data, means converting smaller to bigger data type but reverse case is not done implicitly.[done]
                          b} explicit conversion-- typecast operator (int) before original type. we wont get exception if the source type value is larger than the destination type.[done]
                                                -- Convert class-- we will get an exception if the source value greater. [done]
						-- parse method is used to convert from string to other. throws an exception if it cannot parse the value. [done]
						--tryparse returns an boolean value(true/false) depending upon the condition.[done]

1. Introduction to C#: Namespace,class, reading and writing(concatenation and place holder) to the Console.[done]
2. Built in data types: Boolean, Integer, Float, string, escape sequence, verbatim laiteral.[done]
3. Operators in C#: Assignment op,arithmatic op,comparision op,conditional op,ternary op, null coalescing op.[done]
4. nullable data types: value types can't hold null value where as reference type can have null value.[done]
                        in order to do value type to hv null use "?" next to type of date.[done]
