11.Namespaces. [done]
12. class--A class consists of data and behavior, whwere as data is represented by fields of the class
	   behavior is represented by its functions/methods. [done]
13.constructors and destructors-- constructors are used intialise the fields of the class.[done]
				--this refers object/istance of a class.[done]
				--destructors cleanup the resources that a class was holding. [done]
14. static class members and instance--static members are invoked/calling by the name of the class itself.[done]
15. Inheritence-- allows to reusage of code when required, reduces time and errors.[done]
               --single class inheritance, i.e we cant have two base class.[done]
16. Method hiding. [done]
17. polymorphism and method overloading [In progress]

5.coversion of datatypes: a} implicit conversion-- done by the compiler when there is no loss of data, means converting smaller to bigger data type but reverse case is not done implicitly.[done]
                          b} explicit conversion-- typecast operator (int) before original type. we wont get exception if the source type value is larger than the destination type.[done]
                                                -- Convert class-- we will get an exception if the source value greater. [done]
						-- parse method is used to convert from string to other. throws an exception if it cannot parse the value. [done]
						--tryparse returns an boolean value(true/false) depending upon the condition.[done]
6.arrays and their decalaration, accessing the array elements.[done]
7. Usage of ---if satement,switch,break,goto statement, while, do while loop, for loop.[done]
8. Created github account and repository, gave access to you.[done]
9. created branch,pull request. [done]
10.Methods, method parameters. [done]

1. Introduction to C#: Namespace,class, reading and writing(concatenation and place holder) to the Console.[done]
2. Built in data types: Boolean, Integer, Float, string, escape sequence, verbatim laiteral.[done]
3. Operators in C#: Assignment op,arithmatic op,comparision op,conditional op,ternary op, null coalescing op.[done]
4. nullable data types: value types can't hold null value where as reference type can have null value.[done]
                        in order to do value type to hv null use "?" next to type of date.[done]
