Git : Version control sysytem. Here we can store our data in cloud and can sync to our local computer.			
GitHub : Cloud storage with full fledge version control system.
Git Commands: 
git clone "directory of the folders"
git add-- add files to staging area.
git comit-- comits our data into local version control database.
git push-- stores the data into the cloud.
git difftool--allows us to access the difference done to the data


ls list all the files from default path
cd change the directory
git init git initialisation
git remote add origin link
git remote -v to check the access for fetc and push
git add . uploads all the files stage in the directory ready to push
git comit -m "comment" to save all the changes
git push origin master to push the files into the repository

NuGet is the official package manager for .NET
--it is a visual studio extension which helps us to search,locate the library,
  download them,reference them in our visual studio project and also make appropriate changes to APP and Web config files.

--transforms database development by introducing a common, declarative model that spans all the phases of database development inside Visual Studio.
 You can use SSDT Transact-SQL design capabilities to build, debug, maintain, and refactor databases.

 WPF: Windows Presentation Foundation.
 The idea behind introduction of WPF was that user can develop rich user interface with minimum code complexity.
 wpf : isa a UI
 
 Easy to unit test.
No need to change model to support changes in View.
Very minor changes required in ViewModel to support changes in View.
Separates UX designer and developer i.e the development team can focus on creating ViewModel classes, and the design team can focus on making user-friendly Views.

overriding overloading 


Inheritance: reusability of base/parent class code in the derived class.
base class reference varialble can point to child class object.

polymorphism: enalbles us to invoke derived class methods through base class reference variable at run time.

Method overloading: method can be overloaded based on the number,type(int,float etc) and kind (value,ref or output) of parameters into it.

DLL list creator project:
This code will fetch the .dll files present in the pre-defined diirectory, and will create a file 
of predefined format inside the predefined directory.
Parallely a table will get create(columns will create). Respected record will be addes into the columns.

Architecture project:
This code will print two strings ("x64" , "x86") using console.writeline function by passing
